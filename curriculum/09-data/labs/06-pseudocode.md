Pseudocode Activities
============

Here are some recommendations the bjc nc workshop developed this summer for writing pseudocode. However, 
we recommend letting the students try an activity as below and determine their own conventions. You can 
suggest some, but they can come up with them by making some up and then asking questions about how to implement 
what they do not understand.

 * The first real step is making sure you understand the problem!
 * Write down the requirements of the solution before we start trying to solve it.
 * Declare and initialize variables, once you realize you need them, at the top of the code.
 * Be as non-technical as possible - e.g. try to be readable by a human
 * BUT Be as specific as possible, including as much technical language as possible so as to easily transition into actual code.
 * To do both the above, you can do iterative refinement from more general/abstract to more specific
 * Write out your assumptions, when you realize you are making them 
 * Determine conventions you will use (e.g. == for checking values, arrows or := for assignment, or the word "set" - this is what Snap uses)
 * Label sprites clearly; use descriptive names (naming conventions can help like GuideSprite and GuesserSprite) 
 * If needed, use math operators and show order of operations
 * Use tab or indents to show scope of loops and control structures
 * Think about metaphors that can help in solving the problem - e.g. placeholders as in Steve's story
 * Label the end of scripts so people can tell where they end
 
Activity Ideas
------
Here are some activities you can do in class to make writing pseudocode and plans more concrete for students.
 * Activity 1- Mitch Resnick ( the designer of Scratch) has students give him directions to dance. He stands and students give him commands, which he purposely messes up so they will be more specific.
 
 * Activity 2- Have students write instructions for a task, like going from the classroom to the nearest water fountain. Then have one student be the robot for each, or have teams trade their instructions, try to execute, and correct them. Then discuss what we need to do when we break down a problem into parts. We do an initial breakdown. Then, we should ask: is there anything I need to know to do each task that I don't know? How exactly do I execute each command? Iterate on these until you get to the level of the language you need.
 
 * Activity 3- Have students write instructions/ an algorithm for how to get to school - they write a lot of questions about what they need to know about the starting state (e.g. are you dressed?) - more appropriate for a college classroom.
