Internet Routing Activity Lesson Plan 
=================


Prerequisite
-----
Students need to understand binary representation of data. Our focus will be on abstraction of data. "Cut the words into letters…. But remember these are actually encoded into binary numbers" 


Essential Questions
------
How do we send and receive information via the internet? How and why do packet switching networks operate? 


Activity
-------

 * A students as the courier. Send from group 1 to group 2 

 * Wrap in an envelope. On the envelope the number (packet number). 3 parts of information: where it is going, sequence, where it is coming from. 

 *  Model bandwidth. You take big steps, you take baby steps, different paths. (painters tape on the floor for the path they have to travel. Nodes to pass between more than 1 person.Give it to whoever is available. Between the “student” nodes (sit in a chair). Limited to the number of packets a “student” node can hold. If the node is business the “runner” has to go back to the previous node to get directions. 

 *  Send to multiple groups 

 * Students get to make up the message that is sent. 

 * Corruption of data. (Senders label envelopes with “checksums”. Number of vowels, number of consonants in message. Receivers--look at message, count numbers. If they do not match, request another copy.) --- As part of activity, one of the nodes can substitute a “garbled” or “altered” message, inside the original envelope. 
 * Multiple directions for nodes 

 * Verifying that what you sent is correct. I sent x vowels and y consonants; I received the right numbers of vowels and consonants. 

 * Dropped envelops (packets). How many did you receive? What numbers did you receive? 

 * Remove a node. Now what? What happens to your network. 


Net Neutrality 
-------------
 Give sample of web article that addresses one of these issues then give them the assignment to find another relative article dealing with this same social issue of “securing”. 
 
Students will list of 7 keywords that they identify in the article - (having students determine seven keywords from their own article introduces them to the idea of indexing information for search (also, #Twitter?) and will help them recognize that they need to include key terms in their performance assessments. 

Have them summarize article in one paragraph and give opinion of issue in second paragraph (a paragraph is a minimum of 5 sentences)
