Learning Objectives
-------------------
The Data Portfolio Task addresses the following CS Principles Learning Objectives (LOs):

 * 1: The student can use computing tools and techniques to create artifacts.
 * 2: The student can collaborate in the creation of computational artifacts.
 * 4: The student can use computing tools and techniques for creative expression.
 * 10: The student can use models and simulations to raise and answer questions.

Task
----
This portfolio entry includes work on a team (usually 2 members) and as an individual.You may work with another student in class if possible.

Collaborative portion:
----------------------
Identify and describe a significant area in which you will conduct an investigation to gain insight and knowledge from publicly available data.
 * The area can be an academic topic you are studying or an area of interest.

Develop a set of 3-5 questions that will be the focus of the investigation, find one or more large data sets that will allow you to obtain answers to your questions, and then apply computational tools and techniques to answer your questions, e.g., by finding patterns in the data, by transforming or translating the data, or by finding connections between the data and other sources of knowledge.
 * For example, you could find data in Excel spreadsheet format to analyze by using a pivot table or graph/chart.
 * Data sets can be tables or spreadsheets. Professional organizations (associations) and government organizations are good places to look for data.

Find data (quantitative data) on the Internet to answer your questions
 * For example, a data set that you can pull into Excel (or another program).

Produce an artifact (e.g., a report, video, presentation, visualization, or combinations of these) that will allow someone else to understand your investigation, including both the set of questions you pose and the answers you obtain.

The artifact should
 * describe the computational tools and techniques you use,
 * explanations of why you chose them, and
 * why they are appropriate for your investigation.

Individual portion
------------------
Create a document in which you
 * make it clear that you can use the computational tools and techniques described in your collaborative artifact to verify the answers that are provided there.
 * provide enough details about the tools and techniques and their use with the data and other sources of knowledge so that a skilled reader could verify and reproduce your answers using the same data set and other sources of knowledge.In other words, you should tell me how you analyzed your data so that I could re-create it. This is similar to a lab report in science.

You must include a reflection that describes and analyzes the collaborative aspects of the investigation.

Prepare and submit the following
--------------------------------
A collaboratively developed artifact that communicates a detailed description of your groupâ€™s investigation, the questions, and your collective findings.
 * You may use any form of digital artifact (e.g., a report, video, presentation, visualization, or combinations of these) that allows you to best communicate your investigation and findings.
 * You and your partner will each submit the same artifact.
 * Submit a Works Cited listing all information sources. (MLA format)
 * Submit your data file/s.

An individually written document that addresses the investigation.
 * Each group member must write her/his own individual document.
 * In writing the individual document you must adhere to the Task description above and the Requirements description below in supplying details of your investigation.

Suggestions
-----------
 * If you are interested in researching different occupations try http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_stru.htm
 * If you are interested in researching different colleges try http://www.cfnc.org/index.jsp
 * There are associations associated with every field, look those up for available data.
 * Need help with creating graphs in Excel, try http://www.gcflearnfree.org/excel2010/17

Requirements
------------
 * You must work with a partner on this project.
 * You will collaboratively conduct the investigation: formulating the area to be investigated, developing the questions, finding data set(s) to address those questions, and creating the artifact that allows someone else to understand your investigation.
