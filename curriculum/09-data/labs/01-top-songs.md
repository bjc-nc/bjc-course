Lab: Top Songs
==============

**Learning Objective 13**: The student can use large datasets to explore and discover information and knowledge. [P3]

Evidence for Learning Objective 13: Student work is characterized by:

 * Use of large datasets to extract information and knowledge.
 * Explanation of how large datasets can facilitate exploration and discovery.

Rolling Stone created a list of the top 500 songs of all time. We've created a .csv file of these files. This file, as well as others you will need, is attached.

Task 1
------
Determine the top 10 artists based on how many songs the artist has in the top 100. You have a file of the top 100 artists, associated ranking, and song that received that ranking. The artist with the most songs in the top 100 is the top artist. Look at the top 100 artists and songs. Attempt to identify the top artist by looking over the document.

Next, brainstorm how you would approach this computationally.

Task 2
------
Using a computer, identify the top 10 artists from the top 500. The [.csv file](top500.csv) is also available for you. You can do this anyway you want. If it helps we’ve uploaded the top 500 songs to the IBM Many Eyes website (but you absolutely don’t have to to use this particular tool). That website lives here:

Top 500 songs in many eyes:

http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/datasets/top-500-songs/versions/1

You can also find these songs by searching data sets on the Many Eyes site for ‘song’.

Task 3
------
Does the approach you developed in the last task work with the data that’s the top 1000 rock and roll songs (e.g., as determined by KZOK 102.5)? This data is also attached for you. Spend a couple of minutes looking at it.

Consider the problem of treating all songs equally: the first song and the 500th song count equally in weighting the “top” group by the number of songs in the top 500 (or 1000). What alternatives can you develop to this ranking in determining the “top” group? How would your method of finding the top group change given the alternative you develop?
