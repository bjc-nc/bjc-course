What is Cloud Computing?
========================
Much of our work this semester will be supported by software that is provided as a *service* rather than as a *product*. This is example of [cloud computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing).

For example, the software you used to create your portfolio is an example of cloud computing. Setting up the portfolio used software that was provided as a free service by Google. Your portfolio lives on the cloud, as the Internet is popularly called. Basically, you don't know exactly where your portfolio page is stored, as you would if it were a product (like Microsoft Word) on your laptop.
