Lab- Add Binary Search to the Guessing Game
===========================================
Using the starting code provided in lab 5.01, upload your expanded guessing game.

Your Noseguy sprite should utilize binary search in his Guess function to guess the number in as few guesses as possible.

The best route for this would be to set a maximum and minimum value, and adjust them as Noseguy is told "higher" or "lower" by BYOB. Think how you would play as a human. You should have Noseguy able to guess the number in 4 guesses or less.
