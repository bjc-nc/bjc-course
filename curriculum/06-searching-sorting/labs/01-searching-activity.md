Activity - Searching
====================
We're going to step away from the computer for this activity. First things first: divide up into groups. Let’s examine a common computer science problem: finding a number in a list of numbers. We can assume that the user will provide a specific number to look for, and we need to develop an algorithm that will find what location the number they're searching for is located in (or if it's absent). A computer can only check one position in a list at a time, and checking positions takes time. Let's say we're searching through a list where the numbers are random (within a range) and unique (the same number won't be in there twice). As you might imagine, there are several different ways that you can find a particular number in this type of list, but we know that many algorithms have advantages over others. We'll use a set of numbered cups in this activity to represent different pieces of data. Let’s call the number of cups N.

Our first goal is to find a specific number among a bunch of randomly chosen cups. Using your set of cups as a testbed, work with your group to **develop an algorithm (remember: set of steps) to do this**. Your algorithm should work for any set of random numbers. **Discuss the following ideas with your group to help your thought process:**

 * What strategies exist for finding a particular number in the fewest number of location checks?
 * How many guesses would it take on average to find a number?
 * How many guesses would it take to determine that a number didn’t exist in the list at all?
 * How much additional work will it be to find a number if N were to increase?
