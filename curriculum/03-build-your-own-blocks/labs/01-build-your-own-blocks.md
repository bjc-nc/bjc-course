Lab: Build Your Own Blocks
==========================
Let's open up SNAP at [http://snap.berkeley.edu/run](http://snap.berkeley.edu/run)

As you have seen, SNAP/BYOB is a powerful language that has a substantial
repository of useful blocks for a variety of purposes. However, as you may have
noticed, SNAP/BYOB does not have all the blocks that you may need, and often, it
would prove useful if we could create new blocks.



Make Your Own Block: A Tutorial
-------------------------------
We are going to teach the computer how to draw a square using a block named
```draw square```. Please follow the steps below:

 * Click on make a block at the bottom of the variables tab.
 
![Button](lab-block-1.png)

 * This will open up the ```make a block``` dialog box. Now, you get to choose
   which tab the block should go into. Our block is going to draw a square, so
   let us choose ```Motion```.

 * When we selected ```Motion```, the block became blue. We now have the option of
   making blocks of different shapes. Right now, however, we are just going to
   make a (regular) command block.

 * When we click ```OK```, we should see the block editor below.

 * Use the blocks from the regular menus to create a script that draws a square,
   as shown below.

 * When you click ```OK```, you should be able to use this block as if it were a
   regular block. Since you created the block as a ```Motion``` block, it will
   end up at the bottom of the ```Motion``` tab.

Congratulations! You have just created your own block!
