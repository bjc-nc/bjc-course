Lab: Build Your Own Blocks
==========================
Let's open up SNAP at [http://snap.berkeley.edu/run](http://snap.berkeley.edu/run)

As you have seen, SNAP/BYOB is a powerful language that has a substantial
repository of useful blocks for a variety of purposes. However, as you may have
noticed, SNAP/BYOB does not have all the blocks that you may need, and often, it
would prove useful if we could create new blocks.
