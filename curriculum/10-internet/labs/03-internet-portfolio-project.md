Portfolio Project: Internet
===========================

Learning Objectives
-------------------
The Internet Portfolio Task addresses the following CS Principles Learning Objectives:

 * 1: The student can explain the abstractions in the Internet and how the Internet functions.
 * 2: The student can explain characteristics of the Internet and the systems built on it.
 * 3: The student can analyze how characteristics of the Internet and systems built on it influence their use.
 * 4: The student can connect the concern of cybersecurity with the Internet and systems built on it.
 * 5: The student can analyze how computing affects communication, interaction, and cognition.
 * 6: The student can connect computing with innovations in other fields.
 * 7: The student can analyze the beneficial and harmful effects of computing.
 * 8: The student can connect computing within economic, social, and cultural contexts.

Task
----
 * Identify and describe a significant, contemporary problem and potential solution that are connected by the Internet to a societal, economic, or cultural context. The problem and/or potential solution must have a strong connection to computing and the Internet.
 * You will create a document describing the problem, the potential solution, the societal, economic, or cultural contexts, cyber security concerns, and the relevant characteristics of the Internet. The societal, economic, or cultural context should affect a significant population (more than a few hundred people).
 * Note: In the task description and the text below the phrase “problem and/or solution” means that either the problem, or the solution, or both should have the characteristics referred to. For example, the task description requires that the problem, or the solution, or both, must have a strong connection to computing and the Internet.

Prepare and submit the following
--------------------------------
A single written document that addresses the task and meets all the requirements listed below.
 * The document can include illustrations and non-textual examples.
 * The document does not need to be an essay. For example, it can be a sequence of written paragraphs each of which addresses one of the requirements below, but which does not include words to connect the paragraphs together.
 * You can also write an essay in which the paragraphs are connected.

Requirements
------------
 * Maximum length of essay is 1000 words.
 * MLA Format, Double-spaced, Times New Roman 11 pt
 * Works Cited, MLA format
 * You will also do a 30-second Talking Point in class
 * Identify at least one cyber security concern related to the problem and/or the potential solution depending on which of these are connected to the Internet.
 * Describe the cyber security concern and explain how it relates to the problem or its potential solution or both.
 * Provide a brief but clear description of the problem.
 * Identify and describe the problem clearly.
 * What population is affected and how?
 * If the problem is connected to the Internet describe how. Be sure to address the specific characteristics of the Internet (see Description of Internet Characteristics) relevant to this problem and how the Internet and the problem are connected.
 * Provide a brief but clear description of the potential solution.
 * Describe the potential solution clearly and how it addresses the problem.
 * If the solution is connected to the Internet describe how. Be sure to address the specific characteristics of the Internet (see Description of Internet Characteristics) relevant to this solution and how they enable the solution.
 * Connect your references to the descriptions of the problem and the solution. That is, your descriptions must make explicit references to your sources.
 * Describe one potentially beneficial and one potentially harmful effect the Internet has on society, culture or economics in the context of the problem or the potential solution.
 * Identify and describe one field other than computing that contributed to or is impacted by the problem or the proposed solution, citing at least one specific example. Describe how the field contributes to or is impacted by the problem or its solution.

Your document must make references to two external sources that provide context for the problem and solution.
 * The references should be high quality sources.
 * Each reference should include a URL when appropriate, but also a citation for the reference, e.g., the author and title of the reference.
 * You must include a date on which you accessed the source if the source is online.
 * Each reference should be to something written between September 2012 and today.
 * The references should be to sources of information that anyone can use to learn about the problem or its solution.


Description of Internet Characteristics
---------------------------------------
When you describe the characteristics of the Internet relevant to the problem or its solution or both) you must identify, describe, and explain at least the characteristics below that are relevant and related to the problem or the solution. You only need to identify, describe, and explain those characteristics below that are relevant and related to the problem and/or solution. You may identify characteristics of the Internet in addition to those below.

 * Evolving Internet standards and abstractions (e.g., addresses and names)
 * Hierarchy and redundancy in the Internet
 * Interfaces and protocols of the Internet that enable widespread use
 * The trust model of the Internet and its role in cybersecurity
 * How cryptography affects cybersecurity
