Binary, Hex, and Decimal Numbers
================================

This activity addresses the concept of abstraction. It focuses, in part, on the following learning objectives:

 * 5b. Explanation of how number bases, including binary and decimal, are used for reasoning about digital data.


Introduction
------------

As we've discussed, binary sequences are an important way to represent digital data. Our number system, which we call the *decimal* system, is a *base-10* number system. It uses 10 digits -- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 -- and the places in a decimal number are based on powers of 10 -- i.e., the ones place (10<sup>0</sup>), tens place (10<sup>1</sup>), hundreds place (10<sup>2</sup>), and so on.

The *binary* system is a *base-2* system. It uses just 2 digits -- 0 and 1 -- and the places in the number are based on the powers of two. So we have the ones place (2<sup>0</sup>), the twos place (2<sup>1</sup>), the fours place (2<sup>2</sup>), and so on.

Because binary numbers can get very long, computer scientists use other number systems based on powers of 2 that make it easier to represent digital data. One of these is the *hexadecimal* system, which is a *base-16* system. It has 16 digits -- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. And the places in a hexadecimal number are based on powers of 16. So we have the ones place (16<sup>0</sup>), the sixteens place, (16<sup>1</sup>), the 256-place (16<sup>2</sup>) and so on.

In this homework you will watch a short (10 minute) video about binary numbers and learn how to convert.

To reinforce your understanding of these concepts, try the following quizzes. If you can get ten-in-a-row correct, that's a pretty good indication that you get it.
