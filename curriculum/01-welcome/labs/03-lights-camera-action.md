Lights, Camera, Action
======================
In this activity, you will create a movie or a play.

In general, your movie should have at least:
 * One block that we did not use during lab. (Explore your blocks)
 * Two characters not previously used.
 * Ten (10) total broadcasts of messages. This can be five each, or six/four, etc.
 * Add sounds (Sound Tab)

The activity is open to your creativity -- tell a story, create characters,
experiment with moving sprites around stage
