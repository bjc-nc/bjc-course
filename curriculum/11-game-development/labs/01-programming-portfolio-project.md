Portfolio Project: Programming
==============================


Learning Objectives
-------------------
The Programming Portfolio Task addresses the following CS Principles Learning Objectives:

 * 1: The student can use computing tools and techniques to create artifacts.
 * 2: The student can collaborate in the creation of computational artifacts.
 * 3: The student can analyze computational artifacts.
 * 4: The student can use computing tools and techniques for creative expression.
 * 5: The student can use programming as a creative tool.
 * 8: The student can develop an abstraction.
 * 17: The student can develop an algorithm.
 * 21: The student can explain how programs implement algorithms.
 * 22: The student can use abstraction to manage complexity in programs.
 * 23: The student can evaluate a program for correctness.
 * 24: The student can develop a correct program.
 * 25: The student can collaborate to solve a problem using programming

Task
----
This portfolio entry includes work on a team (usually 2 members) and as an individual.

Collaborative portion
---------------------
 * Collaborate with a partner to identify an area of focus or subject of your choosing in which you can write and reflect on several different programs that solve problems or do something that is personally relevant to you. You will need to create programs with a purpose.
 * The discussion below uses the term area to refer to the subject or focus you have chosen as this first part of this portfolio task.
 * The area you choose should be one that allows you and your partner to write programs that go beyond simple explorations.
 * Work together to write a program to solve a problem in the area you chose or to illustrate features and characteristics of the area.

Individual portion
------------------
Working alone, write another program to solve a different aspect of the problem or to illustrate some other feature or characteristic of the area you chose.

Working alone, produce a single piece of writing that reflects on each of the following:
 * the collaborative experience,
 * the program that resulted from the collaboration, and
 * the program you created individually.

This reflection piece should include an explanation of how you see the programs as part of the area you chose.

Prepare and submit the following
--------------------------------
The program you developed collaboratively with your partner within your area. You and your partner will each submit this same program.
 * Please turn in your brainstorming and storyboards as well.

The program you developed independently within your area.
 * Turn in your storyboards as well

An individually written description and reflection document as described below in the Requirements section. Each group member must write her/his own reflection.

Presentation
------------
Use PowerPoint or Prezi to create your presentation. Each group member should participate in the presentation

Group Portion
 * Discuss your chosen area of focus/subject
 * Discuss your chosen target audience
 * Discuss the program your group created
 * Purpose of the program
 * How it might be used by your focus group

Individual Portion
 * Discuss how your individual program could be used to solve a different aspect of the problem or to illustrate some other feature or characteristic of the area you chose.
 * Each group member should turn in the presentation


Requirements
------------
You must work with a partner on this project. You will collaboratively identify an area and will collaboratively develop a program within that area. You and your partner will work with your instructor to identify a suitable area that lends itself to creating programs that are reasonably complex.

Each program must include each of the following:
 * sequencing,
 * selection (decision statements - If),
 * abstraction (your own procedures), and
 * either iteration (looping) or recursion.
 
 
You are free to determine the purpose of your programs, but your programs should leverage the richness of the area you have chosen. For example, your programs might solve a problem or create something creative or artistic (though you are not limited to these two examples).

Furthermore, your programs should be demonstrate the complexity of the programming environment/language you are working in.

The programs you and your partner produce individually must be different, both in content and purpose, from one another and from the one you write collaboratively. All the programs must be relevant to the area you chose.

Your individually written description and reflection document has a maximum length of 400 words.

Your individually written reflection document should include the following:
 * A brief description that identifies the area in which you and your partner chose to work, as well as the problem you attempted to solve or the features and/or characteristics you attempted to illustrate.
 * A brief description that describes the additional problem that, working alone, you attempted to solve or the features and/or characteristics you attempted to illustrate.
 * A description of why the programs are relevant to the area you chose.

An evaluation of the correctness of both your own individual program and the program you produce with your partner. This evaluation should include
 * a description of the algorithms these programs implement,
 * an explanation of how these programs function at a detailed level, and
 * a justification of why these programs perform correctly.
 * A description of the collaboration process you used to create your shared program.
 * Describe in what ways this process was or was not appropriate for the creation of your shared program.
